# Using DNA language models for the IBIS Challenge
This repository contains scripts for obtaining a solution for the IBIS Challenge (2024) using DNA language models DNABERT-2, GENA-LM and Nucleotide Transformer (NT).

Scripts for GENA-LM and Nucleotide Transformer are run through Jupyter Notebook, for DNABERT-2 are run through command-line.
